It justifies the application of independent sociological methods and concepts to the examination and understanding of the Economy as a sphere of production, consumption and exchange of goods and services, which is observable in all human societies, not only the modern and advanced. It thereby encourages students to relate economic actions to all other forms of social actions observable in society – the religious, the familial, the technological and the political.
