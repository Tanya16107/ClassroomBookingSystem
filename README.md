# ClassroomBookingSystem
As part of Advanced Programming course, developed a desktop based Java application in a group to manage classroom bookings at IIIT-D for administration, faculty, and students. Apart from booking the rooms, students can also use this application to choose courses based on the post-conditions hints specified by them.
