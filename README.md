# ClassroomBookingSystem
As part of Advanced Programming course, developed a desktop based Java application in a group to manage classroom bookings at IIIT-D for administration, faculty, and students. Apart from booking the rooms, students can also use this application to choose courses based on the post-conditions hints specified by them.

## Building & Running
Once in the Classroom Booking System directory, compile the program using the following and then run the application:
```
javac *.java
java Login
```
